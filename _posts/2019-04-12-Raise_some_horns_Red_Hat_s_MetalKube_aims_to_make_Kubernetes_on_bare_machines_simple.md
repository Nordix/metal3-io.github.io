## The Register; Raise some horns: Red Hat's Metal³ aims to make Kubernetes on bare machines simple

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

[Max Smolaks](https://www.theregister.co.uk/Author/Max-Smolaks) talks in
this article about the OpenInfra Days in the UK, 2019: where Metal³ was
revealed earlier last week by Steve Hardy, Red Hat's senior principal
software engineer. The Open Infrastructure Days in the UK is an event
organised by the local Open Infrastructure community and supported by
the OpenStack Foundation. The Open-source software developers at Red Hat
are working on a tool that would simplify the deployment and management
of Kubernetes clusters on bare-metal servers.

Steve told The Register:

> "In some situations, you won't want to run a full OpenStack
> infrastructure-as-a-service layer to provide, potentially, for
> multiple Kubernetes clusters".

Hardy is a notable contributor to OpenStack, having previously worked on
Heat and TripleO projects. He said one of the reasons for choosing
Ironic was its active development – and when new features get added to
Ironic, the Metal³ team gets them "for free".

> "OpenStack has always been a modular set of projects, and people have
> always had the opportunity to reuse components for different
> applications. This is just an example of where we are leveraging one
> particular component for infrastructure management, just as an
> alternative to using a full infrastructure API," Hardy said.

Thierry Carrez, veep of engineering at the OpenStack Foundation also told
The Register:

> "I like the fact that the projects end up being reusable on their own,
> for the functions they bring to the table – this helps us integrate
> with adjacent communities".

Hardy also commented:

> It's still early days for Metal³ - the project has just six
> contributors, and there's no telling when it might reach release.
> "It's a very, very young project but we are keen to get more community
> participation and feedback,".
