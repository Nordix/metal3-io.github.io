## Conference talk: OpenStack Ironic and Bare Metal Infrastructure: All Abstractions Start Somewhere

The history of cloud computing has rapidly layered abstractions on abstractions to deliver applications faster, more reliably, and easier. Serverless functions on top of containers on top of virtualization. However, at the bottom of every stack is physical hardware that has an entire lifecycle that needs to be managed.

In this video, Chris and Julia show how OpenStack Ironic is a solution to the problem of managing bare-metal infrastructure.

## Speakers

[Chris Hoge](https://twitter.com/hogepodge) is a Senior Strategic Program Manager for the OpenStack foundation. He's been an active contributor to the Interop Working Group (formerly DefCore) and helps run the trademark program for the OpenStack Foundation. He also works on collaborations between the OpenStack and Kubernetes communities. Previously he worked as an OpenStack community manager and developer at Puppet Labs and operated a research cloud for the College of Arts and Sciences at The University of Oregon. When not cloud computing, he enjoys long-distance running, dancing, and throwing a ball for his Border Collie.

[Julia Kreger](https://twitter.com/ashinclouds) is Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat. She started her career in networking and eventually shifted to systems engineering. The DevOps movement leads her into software development and the operationalization of software due to the need to automate large-scale systems deployments. She is experienced in conveying an operational perspective while bridging that with requirements and doesn’t mind getting deep down into code to solve a problem.
She is an active core contributor and leader in the OpenStack Ironic project, which is a project she feels passionate about due to many misspent hours in data centres deploying hardware. Prior to OpenStack, Julia contributed to the Shared Learning Infrastructure and worked with large-scale litigation database systems.
