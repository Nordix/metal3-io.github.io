## 1. Environment Setup

> info "Naming"
> For the v1alpha3 release, the Cluster API provider for Metal3 was renamed from
> Cluster API provider BareMetal (CAPBM) to Cluster API provider Metal3 (CAPM3). Hence,
> from v1alpha3 onwards it is Cluster API provider Metal3.

### 1.1. Prerequisites

- System with CentOS 8 or Ubuntu 18.04
- Bare metal preferred, as we will be creating VMs to emulate bare metal hosts
- Run as a user with passwordless sudo access
- Minimum resource requirements for the host machine: 4C CPUs, 16 GB RAM memory
- The host machine should have a floating IP
- Required dependencies: make, kubelet, kubeadm, kubectl, go (version 1.17.5)

### 1.2. Setup

> info "Information"
> If you need detailed information regarding the process of creating a Metal³ emulated environment using metal3-dev-env, it is worth taking a look at the blog post ["A detailed walkthrough of the Metal³ development environment"]({% post_url 2020-02-18-metal3-dev-env-install-deep-dive %}).

This is a high-level architecture of the Metal³-dev-env. Note that for Ubuntu based setup, either Kind or Minikube can be used to instantiate an ephemeral cluster, while for CentOS based setup only Minikube is currently supported. Ephemeral cluster creation tool can be manipulated with EPHEMERAL_CLUSTER environment variable.

<p style="text-align: center">
  <img src="assets/images/metal3-dev-env.svg">
</p>

The short version is: clone [metal³-dev-env](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-dev-env)
and run

```sh
$ make
```

The `Makefile` runs a series of scripts, described here:

- `01_prepare_host.sh` - Installs all needed packages.

- `02_configure_host.sh` - Creates a set of VMs that will be managed as if they
  were bare metal hosts. It also downloads some images needed for Ironic.

- `03_launch_mgmt_cluster.sh` - Launches a management cluster using `minikube` or `kind`
  and runs the `baremetal-operator` on that cluster.

- `04_verify.sh` - Runs a set of tests that verify that the deployment completed successfully.

When the environment setup is completed, you should be able to see `BareMetalHost` (`bmh`) objects in Ready state.

### 1.3. Tear Down

To tear down the environment, run

```sh
$ make clean
```

> info "Note"
> When redeploying metal³-dev-env with a different release version of CAPM3, you
> must set the `FORCE_REPO_UPDATE` variable in `config_${user}.sh` to _true_.

> warning "Warning"
> If you see this error during the installation:
>
> ```
> error: failed to connect to the hypervisor \
> error: Failed to connect socket to '/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock':  Permission denied
> ```
>
> You may need to log out then login again, and run `make clean` and `make` again.

### 1.4. Using Custom Image

Whether you want to run target cluster Nodes with your own image, you can override the three following variables: `IMAGE_NAME`,
`IMAGE_LOCATION`, `IMAGE_USERNAME`. If the requested image with name `IMAGE_NAME` does not
exist in the `IRONIC_IMAGE_DIR` (/opt/metal3-dev-env/ironic/html/images) folder, then it will be automatically
downloaded from the `IMAGE_LOCATION` value configured.

### 1.5. Setting environment variables

> info "Environment variables"
> More information about the specific environment variables used to set up metal3-dev-env can be found [here](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-dev-env/blob/master/vars.md).

To set environment variables persistently, export them from the configuration file used by metal³-dev-env scripts:

```bash
$ cp config_example.sh config_$(whoami).sh
$ vim config_$(whoami).sh
```

## 2. Working with Environment

### 2.1. BareMetalHosts

This environment creates a set of VMs to manage as if they were bare metal
hosts.

There are two different host OSs that metal3-dev-env setup process is tested on.

  1. Host VM/Server on CentOS, while target can be Ubuntu or CentOS, Cirros, FCOS.
  2. Host VM/Server on Ubuntu, while target can be Ubuntu or CentOS, Cirros, FCOS.

The way  k8s cluster is running in the above two scenarios is different. For CentOS `minikube` cluster is used as the source cluster, for Ubuntu a `kind` cluster is being created.
As such, when the host (where the `make` command was issued) OS is CentOS, there should be three libvirt VMs and one of them should be a `minikube` VM.

In case the host OS is Ubuntu, the k8s source cluster is created by using `kind`, so in this case the `minikube` VM won't be present.

To configure what tool should be used for creating source k8s cluster the `EPHEMERAL_CLUSTER` environment variable is responsible.
The `EPHEMERAL_CLUSTER` is configured to build `minikube` cluster by default on a CentOS host and `kind` cluster on a Ubuntu host.

VMs can be listed using `virsh` cli tool.

In case the the `EPHEMERAL_CLUSTER` environment variable is set to `kind` the list of
running virtual machines will look like this:

```sh
$ sudo virsh list
 Id    Name       State
--------------------------
 1     node_0     running
 2     node_1     running
```

In case the the `EPHEMERAL_CLUSTER` environment variable is set to `minikube` the list of
running virtual machines will look like this:

```sh
$ sudo virsh list
 Id   Name       State
--------------------------
 1    minikube   running
 2    node_0     running
 3    node_1     running
```

Each of the VMs (aside from the `minikube` management cluster VM) are
represented by `BareMetalHost` objects in our management cluster. The yaml
definition file used to create these host objects is in `bmhosts_crs.yaml`.

```sh
$ kubectl get baremetalhosts -n metal3 -o wide
NAME     STATUS   STATE       CONSUMER   BMC                                                                                         HARDWARE_PROFILE   ONLINE   ERROR   AGE
node-0   OK       available              ipmi://192.168.111.1:6230                                                                   unknown            true             58m
node-1   OK       available              redfish+http://192.168.111.1:8000/redfish/v1/Systems/492fcbab-4a79-40d7-8fea-a7835a05ef4a   unknown            true             58m
```

You can also look at the details of a host, including the hardware information
gathered by doing pre-deployment introspection.

```sh
$ kubectl get baremetalhost -n metal3 -o yaml node-0

### 2.2. Provision Cluster and Machines

This section describes how to trigger provisioning of a cluster and hosts via
`Machine` objects as part of the Cluster API integration. This uses Cluster API
[v1beta1](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/tree/v1.0.2) and
assumes that metal3-dev-env is deployed with the environment variable
**CAPM3_VERSION** set to **v1beta1**. This is the default behavior. The v1beta1 deployment can be done with
Ubuntu 18.04 or Centos 8 target host images. Please make sure to meet [resource requirements](#11-prerequisites) for successful deployment:

The following scripts can be used to provision a cluster, controlplane node and worker node.

```sh
$ ./scripts/provision/cluster.sh
$ ./scripts/provision/controlplane.sh
$ ./scripts/provision/worker.sh
```


At this point, the `Machine` actuator will respond and try to claim a
`BareMetalHost` for this `Metal3Machine`. You can check the logs of the actuator.

First check the names of the pods running in the `baremetal-operator-system` namespace and the output should be something similar
to this:

```sh
$ kubectl -n baremetal-operator-system get pods
NAME                                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
baremetal-operator-controller-manager-5fd4fb6c8-c9prs   2/2     Running   0          71m
```

In order to get the logs of the actuator the logs of the baremetal-operator-controller-manager instance has to be queried with
the following command:

```sh
$ kubectl logs -n baremetal-operator-system pod/baremetal-operator-controller-manager-5fd4fb6c8-c9prs -c manager
...
{"level":"info","ts":1642594214.3598707,"logger":"controllers.BareMetalHost","msg":"done","baremetalhost":"metal3/node-1", "provisioningState":"provisioning","requeue":true,"after":10}
...
```

Keep in mind that the suffix hashes e.g. `5fd4fb6c8-c9prs` are automatically generated and change in case of a different
deployment.

If you look at the yaml representation of the `Metal3Machine` object, you will see a
new annotation that identifies which `BareMetalHost` was chosen to satisfy this
`Metal3Machine` request.

First list the `Metal3Machine` objects present in the `metal3` namespace:

```sh
$ kubectl get metal3machines -n metal3
NAME                       PROVIDERID                                      READY   CLUSTER   PHASE
test1-controlplane-jjd9l   metal3://d4848820-55fd-410a-b902-5b2122dd206c   true    test1
test1-workers-bx4wp        metal3://ee337588-be96-4d5b-95b9-b7375969debd   true    test1
```

Based on the name of the `Metal3Machine` objects you can check the yaml representation of the object and
see from its annotation which `BareMetalHost` was chosen.

```sh
$ kubectl get metal3machine test1-workers-bx4wp -n metal3 -o yaml
...
  annotations:
    metal3.io/BareMetalHost: metal3/node-1
...
```

You can also see in the list of `BareMetalHosts` that one of the hosts is now
provisioned and associated with a `Metal3Machines` by looking at the `CONSUMER` output column of the following command:

```sh
$ kubectl get baremetalhosts -n metal3
NAME     STATE         CONSUMER                   ONLINE   ERROR   AGE
node-0   provisioned   test1-controlplane-jjd9l   true             122m
node-1   provisioned   test1-workers-bx4wp        true             122m
```

It is also possible to check that which `Metal3Machine` serves as infrastructure for the ClusterAPI `Machine`
objects.

First list the `Machine` objects:

```sh
$ kubectl get machine -n metal3
NAME                     CLUSTER   NODENAME                 PROVIDERID                                      PHASE     AGE   VERSION
test1-6d8cc5965f-wvzms   test1     test1-6d8cc5965f-wvzms   metal3://7f51f14b-7701-436a-85ba-7dbc7315b3cb   Running   53m   v1.22.3
test1-nphjx              test1     test1-nphjx              metal3://14fbcd25-4d09-4aca-9628-a789ba3e175c   Running   55m   v1.22.3
```

As a next step you can check what serves as the infrastructure backend for e.g. `test1-6d8cc5965f-wvzms` `Machine`
object:

```sh
$ kubectl get machine test1-6d8cc5965f-wvzms -n metal3 -o yaml
...
  infrastructureRef:
    apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Metal3Machine
    name: test1-workers-bx4wp
    namespace: metal3
    uid: 39362b32-ebb7-4117-9919-67510ceb177f
...
```

Based on the result of the query `test1-6d8cc5965f-wvzms` ClusterAPI `Machine` object is backed by
`test1-workers-bx4wp` `Metal3Machine` object.

You should be able to ssh into your host once provisioning is completed.
The default username for both CentOS & Ubuntu image is `metal3`.
For the IP address, you can either use API endpoint IP of the target cluster
which is - `192.168.111.249` by default or use predictable IP address of the first
master node - `192.168.111.100`.

```sh
$ ssh metal3@192.168.111.249
```

### 2.3. Deprovision Cluster and Machines

Deprovisioning of the target cluster is done just by deleting `Cluster` and `Machine` objects or by executing the deprovisioning scripts in reverse order than provisioning:

```sh
$ ./scripts/deprovision/worker.sh
$ ./scripts/deprovision/controlplane.sh
$ ./scripts/deprovision/cluster.sh
```

Note that you can easily deprovision worker Nodes by decreasing the number of replicas in the `MachineDeployment` object created when executing the `provision/worker.sh` script:

```sh
$ kubectl scale machinedeployment test1 -n metal3 --replicas=0
```

> warning "Warning"
> control-plane and cluster are very tied together. This means that you are not able to deprovision the control-plane of a cluster and then provision a new one within the same cluster. Therefore, in case you want to deprovision the control-plane you need to **deprovision the cluster** as well and provision both again.

Below, it is shown how the deprovisioning can be executed in a more manual way by just deleting the proper Custom Resources (CR).

The order of deletion is:
1. Machine objects of the workers
2. Metal3Machine objects of the workers
3. Machine objects of the control plane
4. Metal3Machine objects of the control plane
5. The cluster object

An additional detail is that the `Machine` object `test1-workers-bx4wp` is controlled by the the `test1` `MachineDeployment`
object thus in order to avoid reprovisioning of the `Machine` object the  `MachineDeployment` has to be deleted instead of the `Machine` object in the case of `test1-workers-bx4wp`.

```sh
# By deleting the Machine or MachineDeployment object the related Metal3Machine object(s) should be deleted automatically.

$ kubectl delete machinedeployment test1 -n metal3
machinedeployment.cluster.x-k8s.io "test1" deleted

# The "machinedeployment.cluster.x-k8s.io "test1" deleted" output will be visible almost instantly but that doesn't mean that the related Machine
# object(s) has been deleted right away, after the deletion command is issued the Machine object(s) will enter a "Deleting" state and they could stay in that state for minutes
# before they are fully deleted.

$ kubectl delete machine test1-m77bn -n metal3
machine.cluster.x-k8s.io "test1-m77bn" deleted

# When a Machine object is deleted directly and not by deleting a MachineDeployment the "machine.cluster.x-k8s.io "test1-m77bn" deleted" will be only visible when the Machine and the
# related Metal3Machine object has been fully removed from the cluster. The deletion process could take a few minutes thus the command line will be unresponsive (blocked) for the time being.

$ kubectl delete cluster test1 -n metal3
cluster.cluster.x-k8s.io "test1" deleted
```

Once the deletion has finished, you can see that the `BareMetalHosts` are offline  and `Cluster` object is not present anymore

```sh
$ kubectl get baremetalhosts -n metal3
NAME     STATE       CONSUMER   ONLINE   ERROR   AGE
node-0   available              false            160m
node-1   available              false            160m

$ kubectl get cluster -n metal3
No resources found in metal3 namespace.
```

### 2.4. Running Custom Baremetal-Operator

The `baremetal-operator` comes up running in the cluster by default, using an
image built from the [metal3-io/baremetal-operator](https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator) repository. If you’d like to test changes to the
`baremetal-operator`, you can follow this process.

First, you must scale down the deployment of the `baremetal-operator` running
in the cluster.

```sh
$ kubectl scale deployment baremetal-operator-controller-manager -n baremetal-operator-system --replicas=0
```

To be able to run `baremetal-operator` locally, you need to install
[operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework). After that, you can run
the `baremetal-operator` including any custom changes.

```sh
$ cd ~/go/src/github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator
$ make run
```

### 2.5. Running Custom Cluster API Provider Metal3

There are two Cluster API related managers running in the cluster. One
includes set of generic controllers, and the other includes a custom Machine
controller for Metal3. You can try changes to
`cluster-api-provider-metal3` and the changes will be automaticly applied.

### 2.6. Accessing Ironic API

Sometimes you may want to look directly at Ironic to debug something.
The metal3-dev-env repository contains a clouds.yaml file with
connection settings for Ironic.

Metal3-dev-env will install the unified OpenStack and standalone
OpenStack Ironic command-line clients on the provisioning host as
part of setting up the cluster.

Note that currently you can use either unified OpenStack client
or Ironic client. In this example we are using Ironic client to interact
with Ironic API.

Please make sure to export
`CONTAINER_RUNTIME` environment variable before you execute
commands.

Example:

```sh
[notstack@metal3 metal3-dev-env]$ export CONTAINER_RUNTIME=docker
[notstack@metal3 metal3-dev-env]$ baremetal node list
+--------------------------------------+---------------+--------------------------------------+-------------+--------------------+-------------+
| UUID                                 | Name          | Instance UUID                        | Power State | Provisioning State | Maintenance |
+--------------------------------------+---------------+--------------------------------------+-------------+--------------------+-------------+
| b423ee9c-66d8-48dd-bd6f-656b93140504 | metal3~node-1 | 7f51f14b-7701-436a-85ba-7dbc7315b3cb | power off   | available          | False       |
| 882533c5-2f14-49f6-aa44-517e1e404fd8 | metal3~node-0 | 14fbcd25-4d09-4aca-9628-a789ba3e175c | power off   | available          | False       |
+--------------------------------------+---------------+--------------------------------------+-------------+--------------------+-------------+
```

To view a particular node's details, run the below command. The
`last_error`, `maintenance_reason`, and `provisioning_state` fields are
useful for troubleshooting to find out why a node did not deploy.

```sh
[notstack@metal3 metal3-dev-env]$ baremetal node show b423ee9c-66d8-48dd-bd6f-656b93140504
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Field                  | Value                                                      |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
