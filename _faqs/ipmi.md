question: What is IPMI?
---

IPMI is the acronym for `Intelligent Platform Management Interface`
which is used to monitor hardware health (fans, voltage, temperature,
etc). The specification is available at
[here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/servers/ipmi/ipmi-home.html)
and was created by a joint effort by several manufacturers. It allows us
to also define the boot order and power status of the hardware.
